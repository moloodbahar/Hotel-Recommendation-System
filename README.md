# Hotel Recommendation System
This project is a Context-Aware Implicit Feedback based Hotel Recommender System for Anonymous Business Travellers who buy a business flight ticket. This project is part of my master thesis project.


## Objectives
The final approach which we implement to reach these goals for this project guides us to these deliverables:
  • Developing a model-based recommendation system which can work just based on implicit data;
  • Creating the profiles per each user and item by just using the implicit data and the interaction of the users with items based on the transactions data;
  • Having a better performance by embedding these created profiles in the learning process of model-based recommender system;
  • Considering context to give more accurate recommendations to each customer
